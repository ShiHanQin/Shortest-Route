# Shortest-Route
The folder contains a few sample maps represented by "#" and spaces in a text file. 
"S" represents the starting point and "D" represents the destination.
The program uses recursion to find the shortest path through the map, and will print 
out the new map along with the shortest route respresented by a series of asterisks
